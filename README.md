###GAME DROP###

Game Drop is a program designed for gamers who want to share their most exciting moments with their friends and community. Many gamers record their gameplay using GeForce ShadowPlay and Radeon Adrenaline. With Game Drop, users can easily cut and share the last 30 seconds of their game recordings without the need for costly Discord Nitro subscriptions.

The program uses advanced video compression technology from FFMPEG to shrink the recorded footage down to under 8MB, making it easy to share on Discord and other platforms. This means that users can share their clips with a few clicks, without having to worry about large file sizes or long upload times.

The program is also very user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for anyone to use. Users can easily select their preferred Discord channel to share their clips and the program will automatically send the footage to that channel.

Game Drop is perfect for streamers, content creators, and anyone who wants to share their game moments with their friends and community. 

With Game Drop, gamers can easily capture and share their most exciting moments and take their content creation to the next level. Whether you're a competitive player or just enjoy showing off your gameplay, Game Drop is the perfect tool for sharing your gaming experiences with the world.
